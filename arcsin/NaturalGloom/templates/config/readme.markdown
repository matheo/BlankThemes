# About this folder

In this folder you store the configurations of the different sections of your site. This allows you to assign any module for them in the Theme Admin Panel.

If you need different layouts for different sections, you can use the page variables to override the master ones (stored on themevariables.ini). For a example on how body and layout are overrided, check nocolumns.ini, noleftcolumn.ini and norightcolumn.ini.

You will be able to modify the page variables from the Theme Admin Panel too.
