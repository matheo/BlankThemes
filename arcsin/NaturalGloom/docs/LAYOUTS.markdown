# Available Layouts

The available layouts are supported by the body templates, located at the _/templates/body_ subfolder, and are as follows:

## 2 colums (2col)

Supports all the available two column distributions, the main column at the left or right, with one of the side columns with the left/right blockpositions (by default).
